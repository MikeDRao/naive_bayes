# Naive Bayes Classifier:

Naive Bayes classification for any MAchine Learning Usecase:

For any dataset d and class c;class usually refers the sentiments either positive or negative:



P(c|d)= 

P(d|c).P(c)  
         _________  
                    P(d)



P(d|c)--->Likelihood
P(c)--->Prior
P(d)--->Normalization Constant


Where:
Likelihood is the probability of dataset on the class c;either positive or negative.
Prior is the original label of the document being either positive or negative.
Normalization constant is the term divided with the result produced by multiplication to present it as probability distribution.
